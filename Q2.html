        It is a known fact that the right styleguide can significantly increase development speed, debugging, and the
        implementation of new features in legacy code. Sadly, most CSS codebases are sometimes developed without any
        structure or naming conventions. This leads to an unmaintainable CSS codebase in the long term.

        The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the development of a website works with a single
        codebase and speaks the same language. Using proper naming will prepare you for the changes in design of the
        website.

        Modifier names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. CSS class is formed as block’s or
        element’s name plus two dashes: .block--mod or .block__elem--mod and .block--color-black with .block--color-red.
        Spaces in complicated modifiers are replaced by dash

    <p class="bg--default">
        Modifier is an extra class name which you add to a block/element DOM node. Add modifier classes only to
        blocks/elements they modify, and keep the original class.
